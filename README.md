## Welcome to my Software Workshop... more like Junkyard!

My name is Mohammed Ward Khaled Al-Nakchbandi, I'm a high school student in Syria whose passion in game modding eventually pulled him into the rabbit hole of software development and Linux*.



In my free time I develop software, GTK GUIs and packages for my own distro PikaOS Linux, and GlouriousEggroll's Nobara Project.

With a little help from Google and StackOverflow:
I can almost comfortably work with the following Programing Languages:

- Rust
- Python
- Bash
- Golang
- C (pointers break me)

And the following GUI APIs:

- GTK4
- GTK3
- Libadwaita

In the future would hope to able to properly learn the above languages and write efficient code, that's less dependent on outsourcing to bash and other questionable practices, but with my extremely limited time, and resources this will do ***FOR NOW***.

I also dream of becoming proficient in creating wine and Linux patches like GE and TKG

### My Creations:
- **fedora-amdgpu-pro** : A list of scripts to cleanly install amdgpu-pro components on Nobara and Fedora Linux, and have them only load on demand for the perfect mix of performance and professional workforce support.
- **pika-drivers/nobara-drivers** : A GTK4 Libadwaita program written in Rust, for managing all sorts of drivers on Nobara and PikaOS.
- **PikaOS Linux** : A Linux Distro Based on Ubuntu without snaps Bringing features from all my favorite distros (Nobara,CachyOS,VanillaOS,PopOS,Linux Mint)
